{"result": "Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that represents systems with hidden states and observed data. It is widely used in various applications, including bioinformatics, time series analysis, and pattern recognition. HMMs are particularly useful for modeling hidden state transitions and observation distributions, which is a key component in the Viterbi decoding algorithm.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
