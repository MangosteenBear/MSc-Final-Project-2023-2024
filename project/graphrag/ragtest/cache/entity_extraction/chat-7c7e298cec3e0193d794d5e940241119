However, the use of dynamic programming (Section 5) makes this tractable, leading to efficient, lineartime $O\\left(T K^{2}\\right)$ inference algorithms.\n\n 17.2. Viterbi decoding\n\nThis course will investigate the efficient Viterbi decoding algorithm for HMMs. Stated mathematically, the problem to be solved is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP\\left(y^{\\star}\\right)=\\max _{y^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{Y}} P\\left(X_{0}=x_{0}, \\ldots, X_{T}=x_{T}, Y_{0}=y_{0}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, Y_{T}=y_{T}^{\\prime}\\right) \\tag{17.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ is the set of observed data, $y=\\left[y_{0}, y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{T}\\right]$ is a hidden sequence, and the configuration space $\\mathcal{Y}$ is the set of all possible such sequences of hidden states over time $t=0$ to $t=T$. For example, with $\\Omega_{Y}=\\{1,2,3\\}$ so that $K=3$ and $T=3$, then particular hidden sequences are $y=[1,2,1,3]$ and $y=[3,2,2,1]$. The hidden state can change from any of the $K$ states at time $t$, to any of the $K$ states at time $t+1$. So, if there are $t=0,1, \\ldots, T$ time stages, there are $K^{T+1}$ possible sequences, an intractable exponential number of possible sequences over which to maximize (17.2).\n\nHowever, there is a factorized SDP for these hidden sequences, through which we can use dynamic programming to make this maximization tractable. Assume we have the sequence of states for stage $t-1$. The $K$ new sequences of states at stage $t$, is simply obtained from each sequence at stage $t-1$, by appending each of the $K$ possible states. Now, considering the HMM graphical model up to stage $t-1$, associated with the sequence of states is the (joint) optimal distribution (for clarity, we drop the assignment of observed data to their random variables),\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP^{\\star}\\left(X_{0}, \\ldots, X_{t-1}, Y_{t-1}\\right)=\\max _{y^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{Y}_{t-2}} P\\left(X_{0}, \\ldots, X_{t-1}, Y_{0}=y_{0}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, Y_{t-2}=y_{t-2}^{\\prime}, Y_{t-1}\\right) \\tag{17.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{Y}_{t-2}$ is the set of all possible hidden sequences up to time $t-2$.\n\nAccording to the SDP above, associated to every one of the newly generated hidden sequences at each value of $y \\in \\Omega_{Y}$, is the probability obtained by appending the variables $X_{t}=x_{t}$ and $Y_{t}=y$, to the PGM at stage $t-1$, so that,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP\\left(X_{0}, \\ldots, X_{t-1}, X_{t}, Y_{t-1}, Y_{t}=y\\right)=P\\left(X_{0}, \\ldots, X_{t-1}, Y_{t-1}\\right) P\\left(Y_{t}=y \\mid Y_{t-1}\\right) P\\left(X_{t} \\mid Y_{t}=y\\right) \\tag{17.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nMaximizing over $Y_{t}$ leads to,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP^{\\star}\\left(X_{0}, \\ldots, X_{t}, Y_{t}=y\\right)=\\max _{y^{\\prime} \\in \\Omega_{Y}} P^{\\star}\\left(X_{0}, X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{t-1}, Y_{t-1}=y^{\\prime}\\right) P\\left(Y_{t}=y \\mid Y_{t-1}=y^{\\prime}\\right) P\\left(X_{t} \\mid Y_{t}=y\\right) \\tag{17.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nand writing $p_{t}^{\\star}(y)=P^{\\star}\\left(X_{0}, \\ldots, X_{t}, Y_{t}=y\\right)$ shows that the above is in the form of a Bellman recursion, ${ }^{1}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\np_{t}^{\\star}(y)=\\max _{y^{\\prime} \\in \\Omega_{Y}} p_{t-1}^{\\star}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right) P\\left(Y_{t}=y \\mid Y_{t-1}=y^{\\prime}\\\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
