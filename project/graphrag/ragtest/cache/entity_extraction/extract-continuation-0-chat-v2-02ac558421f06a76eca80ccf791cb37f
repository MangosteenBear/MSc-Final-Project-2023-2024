The HMM hidden state transition $P\\left(Y=y \\mid Y=y^{\\prime}\\right)$, observation distributions $P(X=x \\mid Y=y)$ and initial distribution $P\\left(Y_{0}=y\\right)$ are given in the text.\n\nand the DNA sequence is the observed data $\\Omega_{X}=\\{a, c, g, t\\}$. Knowledge of the molecular biology and experimental work has determined the following state transition and observation distributions,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& P\\left(Y=y \\mid Y=y^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} \n& y=e & y=d & y=i \\\\\ny^{\\prime}=e & 0.9 & 0.1 & 0 \\\\\ny^{\\prime}=d & 0 & 0 & 1.0 \\\\\ny^{\\prime}=i & 0.1 & 0 & 0.9\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\n& P(X=x \\mid Y=y)=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\ny=e & x=a & x=c & x=g & x=t \\\\\ny=e & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 \\\\\ny=d & 0.05 & 0 & 0.95 & 0 \\\\\ny=i & 0.4 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.4\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{17.8}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand the assumption is that the sequence always starts at an exon, e.g. $P\\left(Y_{0}=e\\right)=1, P\\left(Y_{0}=d\\right)=0$ and $P\\left(Y_{0}=i\\right)=0$. This encodes the known biological facts that exons can be followed by donor sites, but not directly by introns; and donor sites can only be followed (immediately) by introns etc. Donor sites consist only of AG base pairs. This is enough information to run the Viterbi algorithm on a given DNA sequence to determine the optimal sequence of segments (Table 17.1). Since this DP algorithm runs in linear time, it can be easily applied to the usually extremely long DNA sequences encountered in biology (i.e. the human genome has about 6 billion base pairs), and is a good example of the ubiquitous use of ML in modern bioinformatics.\n\nAn important computational point needs to be raised.
