Global and local optima\n\nExact optimization methods are completely reliable, but typically quite slow, whereas approximate methods can be fast but not necessarily reliable. Approximate methods cannot guarantee finding an optimal solution to (3.1), only a solution which is 'good enough' for a specific purpose. Various algorithm strategies for approximate optimization exist: stochastic (randomized), greedy ${ }^{1}$, tabu search, genetic optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing, local beam search and many others. Approximate methods usually start with some guess configuration and aim to find a configuration which has an objective function value which is at least better than the starting guess.\n\nWithout additional information about a specific problem, a few things can be said in general about approximate optimization methods (see Figure 3.1):\n\n1. In the search for an improvement over the starting configuration, they can become \"trapped\" in local optima which are indistinguishable from global optima,\n2. The success of any approximate algorithm can be heavily dependent upon the starting guess: a good guess near to the global optima will be better than a bad guess close to a local optima and/or far from the global one, however, since there is no way in general of discriminating global from local optima we cannot know whether the starting guess is good or bad (without comparing different starting guesses),\n3. It is usually not possible to know how good a local optima is, by comparison to the (unknown) global optima.\n4. If the algorithm stops at an optima, this may actually be the global optima, but there is no way to know this in general.\n\nSome sophisticated stochastic algorithms have convergence guarantees, for example, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as simulated annealing (which we will investigate below) but only in the limit of an infinite number of iterations. Even in this situation, the number of iterations required to find a configuration whose objective is within some required tolerance of the optimal solution, is typically unknown.\n\n\\footnotetext{\n${ }^{1}$ Here greedy refers to approximate greedy, not exact greedy.\n\n\nAlgorithm 6.1 Approximate greedy search for combinatorial optimization of AI problems.\n  \n $\\triangleright$ Step 1. Initialization: Start with iteration $n=0$, select an initial candidate configuration $X_{0}$, choose a maximum number of iterations $R$.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Step 2. Neighbourhood search: Find the configuration $X^{\\prime}$ within the configuration neighbourhood $\\mathcal{N}\\left(X_{n}\\right)$ with smallest objective function value $F\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)$, and set $X_{n+1}=X^{\\prime}$. If $F\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq F\\left(X_{n}\\right)$, then terminate with $X^{\\star}=X_{n}$.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Step 3. Iteration: Set $n=n+1$, and while $n \\leq R$, go back to step 2 , otherwise exit with solution $X^{\\star}=X_{n}$.\n\n6.2. Approximate greedy search\n\nIn this section we will explore a simple but often surprisingly effective, approximate method known as greedy approximate search, hill-climbing or iterative improvement (Algorithm 6.1). It is based on the idea of performing many searches which are optimal within a certain neighbourhood of the current configuration, and using the best known local configuration to centre the next local search. When this algorithm becomes trapped at some optima in the objective function (as it will eventually), it terminates with the last best known configuration.\n\nTo use the algorithm we need a definition of configuration neighbourhood, $\\mathcal{N}(X)$ of some configuration $X$. There are many ways to measure distance (the mathematical name for which is metric) between configurations, one widely used metric is the Hamming distance $d\\left(X, X^{\\prime}\\right)$ which counts the number of elements of the two configurations $X$ and $X^{\\prime}$ which differ. For instance, if the configurations are permutations, then $d\\left(X, X^{\\prime}\\right)$ would measure the number of places in which the permutations disagree; when they are the same permutation then $d(X, X)=0$. Thus a combinatorial neighbourhood based on this metric ${ }^{2}$ would be defined mathematically as\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathcal{N}(X)=\\left\\{X^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{X}: d\\left(X, X^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq r\\right\\} \\tag{6.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor some given maximum Hamming distance $r>0$.\n\nSome facts about the behaviour of this algorithm can be inferred directly. Firstly, by design, the sequence of candidate configurations at each iteration $X_{0}, X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots$ will have decreasing objective function value, i.e. $F\\left(X_{n+1}\\right)<F\\left(X_{n}\\right)$ for all $n=0,1,2, \\ldots$. Because the algorithm is approximate, there is no guarantee that the final value $X^{\\star}$ coincides with the global minima. The algorithm could finish before $n=R\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
