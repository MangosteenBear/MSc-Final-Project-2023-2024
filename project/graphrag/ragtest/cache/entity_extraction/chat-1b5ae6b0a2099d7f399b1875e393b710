The column on the right are all derivatives of the corresponding function in the same row on the left.\n\nFigure 13.2.: (Left) The perceptron as a single neuron which takes multiple inputs, sums them together and applies a nonlinear activation (here, the ReLU) function to create the output, $y=\\max \\left(0, w^{T} x\\right)$ (Right) Extending the perceptron to two layers, with nonlinear activations connecting them through hidden neurons $z$ whose output is fed into the output layer creating the final output $y$, e.g. $z=$ $\\max \\left(0, W^{T} x\\right)$ and $y=\\max \\left(0, v^{T} z\\right)$, leads to the basic multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This is the simplest (fully-connected, two-layer) deep learning algorithm.\n\nfed into the input of another neuron, leads to the simple two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& z=\\max \\left(0, W^{T} x\\right) \\\\\n& y=\\max \\left(0, v^{T} z\\right) \\tag{13.2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $W$ is a matrix of weights, so that each column is a vector of weights for each of the $M$ hidden perceptrons in the second layer,\n\n$$\nW=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nw_{1,1} & w_{1,2} & \\cdots & w_{1, M}  \\tag{13.3}\\\\\nw_{2,1} & w_{2,2} & \\cdots & w_{2, M} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nw_{D, 1} & w_{D, 2} & \\cdots & w_{D, M}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nand $v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{M}$ are the weights for the perceptron at the output layer (Figure 13.2).\n\nExtending to multiple layers in this way, with more than two sets of hidden neurons, leads to the number of total number weights growing rapidly (for example, for three fully connected layers with $D$ inputs, $M$ nodes in the first hidden layer, $N$ in the second layer and a single output node, the number of weights is $D M+M N+N)$. Furthermore, there are situations where it makes sense to have the weights shared between connections. A classical example of this is the convolutional neural network (CNN) which is well-suited to ordered data such as images and time series (Figure 13.3). For instance, in image data, it does not usually matter where exactly in the image an object is located - it could be translated up/down or left/right ${ }^{2}$ - so an object detection neural network might have weight sharing in overlapping patches (windows).\n\n\\footnotetext{\n${ }^{2}$ This property is known as translation invariance.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_151247482eb284cd9e4eg-4.jpg?height=521&width=644&top_left_y=328&top_left_x=432)\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nz^{1}=\\max \\left(0, w^{T}\\left[x^{I} x^{2}\\right]^{T}\\right) \\\\\nz^{2}=\\max \\left(0, w^{T}\\left[x^{2} x^{3}\\right]^{T}\\right) \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\nz^{M}=\\max \\left(0, w^{T}\\left[x^{D-1} x^{D}\\right]^{T}\\right) \\\\\ny=\\max \\left(0, v^{\\mathrm{T}} z\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nFigure 13.3.: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN), which shares two weights in the input layer across the whole input sequence, e.g. $w_{1} x^{1}+w_{2} x^{2}, w_{1} x^{2}+w_{2} x^{3}, w_{1} x^{3}+w_{2} x^{4}$ etc. This allows the network to learn patterns where the specific location in the sequence of the input, does not matter, and is well suited to time series (it is said to have 'time shift invariance').\n\n 13.3. Example: deep logic networks\n\nMultilayer deep networks can compute pretty much any desired function of the inputs. Here we will explore the use of deep networks for a problem in symbolic AI: computing logical functions such as the connectives in propositional calculus (Section 8).\n\nTo illustrate the idea, the activation we will use is the function $\\operatorname{sign}(x)$ which is +1 if $x>0$, -1 if $x<0$ and 0 otherwise. This is much like the step function in Figure 13.1. The goal will be to use the output of the activation $\\operatorname{sign}(x)$ with -1 representing False, and +1 representing True. We will construct a system of logical computation based on the use of the neural network function $f_{b}(w,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
