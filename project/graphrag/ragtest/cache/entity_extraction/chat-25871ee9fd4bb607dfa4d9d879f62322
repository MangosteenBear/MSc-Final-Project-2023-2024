This shows how the optimization problem can be solved efficiently by maximizing over each successive time step, which is an $O\\left(T K^{2}\\right)$ process, i.e. linear time computation. This process of generating new state sequences by appending states, and corresponding joining of PGMs together which makes the DP recursion possible, is illustrated in Figure 17.2.\n\nTo get the recursion (17.6) started, we only need the initial probability function, $p_{0}^{\\star}(y)=P\\left(X_{0} \\mid Y_{0}=y\\right) P\\left(Y_{0}=y\\right)$. The optimal sequence of states $y^{\\star}$ can be reconstructed by (a) retaining the optimal decision at each stage, (b) solving for $y_{T}^{\\star}$ by optimizing over $p_{T}^{\\star}(y)$, then (c) using the retained decisions to work backwards from $y_{T}^{\\star}$. Putting this together leads to Viterbi decoding, Algorithm 17.1.\n\n 17.3. Example: genome sequence region segmentation\n\nGenome sequences are made from four DNA base pair molecules: adenosine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). Sub-sequences of three ACGT base pairs encode for different amino acids, which ultimately go to make up proteins which are the building blocks of every part of the living cell. Different sub-sequences of the DNA sequence have different functions in this process, which involves splicing together coding regions called exons (E), and discarding introns (I) and untranslated 5' donor site (D) sub-sequences.\n\nFor molecular biology it is very useful to be able to segment a sequence into these diferent subsequences. As the relationship between DNA sequences and coding/non-coding regions is complex, it is well-modelled as an HMM, where the hidden states $\\Omega_{Y}=\\{e, d, i\\}$ are the $K=3$ possible regions,\n\n\\footnotetext{\n${ }^{1}$ This function has various names in the literature, including the forward optimal message $\\alpha(y)$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_7cba98d7a35fdf29e4a8g-4.jpg?height=624&width=1357&top_left_y=493&top_left_x=221)\n\nFigure 17.2.: Illustrating the relationship between the SDP which generates new hidden state sequences from previous ones through appending states, and the corresponding process of appending variables and their Markov dependencies, to the PGM to create new, extended PGMs and associated distribution function.\n\n\nAlgorithm 17.1 The Viterbi decoding algorithm for determining the optimal sequence of hidden states in an HMM.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Step 1.
