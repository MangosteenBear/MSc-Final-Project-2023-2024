In fact, this can be done for any reasonable activation function.\n\n[^1]:    ${ }^{5}$ This is the disjunctive normal form for the 'xnor' function\n\n    ${ }^{6}$ There is a way to simplify this to remove one hidden layer if we use the fact that $\\operatorname{sign}(x)=x$, provided the inputs are always logical values -1 and +1 .\n\n\n Section 14. \n\n Automatic differentiation\n\nRelevant reference reading material for this section: PRML, Section 5.3, R\\&N, Section 18.7 and $\\mathbf{H \\& T}$, Section 11.4 and Section 11.7.\n\n 14.1. Deep neural networks and automatic differentiation\n\nGradient descent is an extremely versatile method for producing good solutions to optimization problems in ML. Single layer linear perceptron training was shown to be relatively straightforward: just use SGD to minimize the perceptron objective $F(w)$ with respect to the weights $w$, given the input training input data $x$ and labels $y$. The expression (12.2) for the gradient $F_{w}(w)$ is not too complicated to calculate by hand. However, to train hidden layer weights $v$ in deep networks, we must propagate gradients from the output error $F(w)$, all the way through each layer. Analytical gradient expressions quickly become intractable. Noting that we do not generally need to care about the specific form of this gradient function, only that it can be easily calculated, motivates the use of more sophisticated gradient calculation methods. Widely used are backpropagation and automatic differentiation (AD) There are many different backpropagation and AD schemes, principally forward and reverse mode; depending upon whether the gradient computations start with values at the input to the network, or start with values obtained at the output instead. We will discuss forward mode AD for its conceptual simplicity. ${ }^{1}$\n\nAutomatic differentiation is a meta-programming approach to gradient calculation. By this it is meant: the actual primitive computations which are carried out by a computer to evaluate some ML function, are 'shadowed' by simultaneous calculation of the gradient of that function in the background (Figure 14.1). ${ }^{2}$ Unlike numerical gradients, AD computations are exact in the sense that, if the gradient functions of the primitives are accurate, then the final gradients will generally be accurate too. Unlike (analytical) symbolic differentiation, the full mathematical expression for the gradient is rarely, if ever, actually calculated; the goal is to efficiently compute accurate gradients the point evaluated by the function that is to be differentiated, rather than anything other aims.\n\nSoftware packages such as PyTorch and JAX help the programmer largely avoid the need for finding any hand-computed gradients in this way and have become an essential tool in deep learning research and AI industries. In this section we will study how the technique works and carry out some toy calculations to demonstrate this; in practice, gradient computations involve substantial computations and are therefore best explored computationally.\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_62bfeca903b48d2ca0efg-2.jpg?height=947&width=846&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=659)\n\nFigure 14.1.: Automatic differentiation (AD) obtains the gradients of the output of a deep neural network simultaneous with the output of the network itself, using the information available to, or computed by, the network at each stage.\n\n 14.2. Chain rule of calculus and dual numbers\n\nNearly all functions computing anything signficantly useful in ML, involve composition, that is, they require chains of functions applied to the output of other functions. Gradients of composite functions such as $F(f(x))$, are found using the chain rule of calculus:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{d}{d x} F(f(x))=F^{\\prime}(f(x)) \\times f^{\\prime}(x) \\tag{14.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $f^{\\prime}(u)$ is shorthand for $\\frac{d f}{d u}(u)$. As can be seen, this involves the gradients of the first function in the composite, $f^{\\prime}(x)$ and the second function $F^{\\prime}(u)$, along with the value of the first function, $f(x)$. The output of the composite $F(f(x))$, will generally become the first function in the next composite, and so on. Therefore, to calculate the gradient of a composite function, the value of the first function is also needed, which implies that for computational efficiency reasons it makes sense to compute the gradient along with the value of the function at the same time. Dual numbers, represented as a pair $\\left(u, u^{\\prime}\\right)$, are a convenient algebraic tool to handle such chained computations, which keeps track of both the current computation's value $u$ and the value of its' derivative $u^{\\prime}$ together, as a sequence of functions, $f$, are applied, ${ }^{3}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf\\left(\\left(u, u^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)=\\left(f(u), f^{\\prime}(u) u^{\\prime}\\right) \\tag{14.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n[^1\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
