The problem of finding genuine pulsars from among highly diverse radio noise is not easily posed as a simple software problem because the interference can be arbitrarily complex and pulsars have multiple different sorts of oscillation 'signatures'. Furthermore, in modern digital sky surveys it is possible to identify many thousands of candidate signals which could be pulsars; sorting out spurious noise from actual pulsars is a laborious process. This is an ideal task for supervised, probabilistic ML classification because the genuine and spurious pulsar signatures have a fairly significant level of uncertainty but it is relatively easy to check pulsars by hand which can then be used as training data for a Bayesian classifier.\n\nTo apply the naive Bayes classifier to the HTRU2 pulsar dataset ${ }^{4}$ we first need to decide on the conditional models for each putative pulsar feature. For simplicity we will use Gaussian distribution models because most of the features commonly used to identify pulsars are continuous. In the case of\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_bd3610f74bd1741e4f7bg-5.jpg?height=895&width=1157&top_left_y=295&top_left_x=444)\n\nFigure 16.3.: Using naive Bayes' classification to solve the problem of automatically detecting pulsars among spurious radio interference from the automated High Time Resolution Universe digital sky survey. The conditional class likelihood models for each of the two features are Gaussian, where the means of each Gaussian under the two detection condition classes ( $y=1$, spurious interference and $y=2$, genuine pulsar) are shown in the distribution panels. The centre panel shows a point in $X^{1}-X^{2}$ space for each potential pulsar candidate in the dataset.\n\ntwo features, $X^{1}$ (excess kurtosis of the integrated candidate pulsar profile) and $X^{2}$ (excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve), we need the mean and variance parameters for each, conditional on each class, $Y=1$ (spurious) and $Y=2$ (pulsar). Splitting the training data into two halves, the estimate of on the training set gives, for feature $X^{1}$ in the spurious and pulsar cases, $\\mu_{x 1 y 1}=0.2$ and $\\mu_{x 2 y 1}=8.70$, respectively. For feature $X^{2}$, the same means are $\\mu_{x 1 y 2}=3.1$ and $\\mu_{x 2 y 2}=2.86$. Similarly, for variances the parameters are $\\sigma_{x 1 y 1}^{2}=0.11, \\sigma_{x 2 y 1}^{2}=17.15, \\sigma_{x 1 y 2}^{2}=3.49$ and $\\sigma_{x 2 y 2}^{2}=8.50$. The class priors are just $p_{y 1}=0.87$ and $p_{y 2}=0.13$. We can see immediately very substantial class imbalance in this case (because most of the potential pulsar signals are just radio interference). It is important to visualize the training dataset and conditionally independent feature models together (Figure 16.3).\n\nHaving these feature model parameters immediately allows computation of the test set performance of the naive Bayes' classifier, by applying the inference formula (16.12) to obtain the most probable class $y_{i}^{\\star}$ for each data set item $x=\\left[x^{1}, x^{2}\\right]$ in the test split of the dataset. The $0-1$ classification error can then be calculated as $F_{01}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{I}\\left[y_{i}^{\\star} \\neq y_{i}\\right]$ where $y_{i}$ is the known label. In this case, the naive Bayes' classifier has $F_{01}=1181$ classification errors in test set size $N=8950$ candidates, giving a test set accuracy of approximately $80 \\%$.\n\nThis is quite good accuracy for such a simple model, but not sufficiently accurate for scientific purposes in astronomy. It would be reasonable to trust those pulsar candidates with high posterior probability, which can be calculated by dividing through by the evidence probability $P\\left(x^{1}, x^{2}\\right)=$ $\\sum_{y \\in\\{0,1\\}} P\\left(X^{1}=x^{1} \\mid Y=y\\right) P(Y=y)$ in each test case. In fact for this model, $91 \\%$ of the predicted cases have posterior probability of $75 \\%$ or higher, thus leaving only about $10 \\%$ of cases which might\nneed to be checked by hand (i.e. about 900 cases out of nearly 9000), very substantially reducing the labour required to obtain good quality scientific evidence.\n\n Learning outcomes for section 16\n\n$\\triangleright$ Show understanding of Bayes' theorem: prior, posterior, evidence and likelihood distributions, swapping conditionals.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Demonstrate the principle of MAP inference as applied to probabilistic classification.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Explain the rational behind, probabilistic structure of, and method of, naive Bayes classification: apply naive Bayes' to small classification problems.\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ This is actually a general fact about $\\arg \\max$ and $\\arg \\min$ : they are unchanged if the quantity being maximized is multiplied (or\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
