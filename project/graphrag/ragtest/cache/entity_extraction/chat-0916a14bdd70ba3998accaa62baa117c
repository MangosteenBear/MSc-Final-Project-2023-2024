Because the algorithm is approximate, there is no guarantee that the final value $X^{\\star}$ coincides with the global minima. The algorithm could finish before $n=R$, but we cannot predict in advance when it will terminate. There is trade off between the neighbourhood size $r$, and the efficiency of the algorithm. If $r$ is large, the search will be slow, but since each iteration covers more of the space $\\mathcal{X}$, it is more likely to find the global optima. If $r$ is small, each iteration will be fast, but the more likely the algorithm will be to get trapped in local optima and never find the global optima.\n\n6.3. Example: maximum sum combinations\n\nTo illustrate greedy search, we will investigate the maximum sum combination problem, that is, finding a size- $M$ combination of the $N$ input data items, such that the sum of this combination is maximized. For instance, with input data $x=[0.5,-0.1,0.3,-0.2]$, the optimal size 2 combination is\n\n\\footnotetext{\n${ }^{2} \\mathrm{Or}$ any other combinatorial metric, in fact.\n\n| Iteration | Configuration $X_{n}$ | Objective value $F\\left(X_{n}\\right)$ |\n| :--- | :--- | ---: |\n| $n=0$ (initialize) | $\\{0.33,-0.19,-0.59,-0.14\\}$ | -0.59 |\n| $n=1$ | $\\{0.33,-0.19, \\mathbf{2 . 1 8},-0.14\\}$ | 2.18 |\n| $n=2$ | $\\{0.33, \\mathbf{1 . 1 9}, 2.18,-0.14\\}$ | 3.56 |\n| $n=3$ | $\\{\\mathbf{1 . 1 9}, 1.19,0.33,2.18\\}$ | 4.89 |\n| $n=4$ (terminate) | $\\{1.19,1.19, \\mathbf{1 . 0 7}, 2.18\\}$ | 5.63 |\n\nTable 6.1.: Example output from approximate greedy search, Algorithm 6.1, applied to the maximum sum combination problem, for input data size $N=40$ and combination size $M=4$. The neighbourhood search uses Hamming distance with radius $r=1$. In this run, the globally optimal solution is found by the algorithm after 4 iterations. The bold numbers at each stage highlight values from the input which are replaced during each stage. Input data values are $x=[-0.43,-1.67,0.13,0.29,-1.15$, $1.19,1.19,-0.04,0.33,0.17,-0.19,0.73,-0.59,2.18,-0.14,0.11,1.07,0.06,-0.10,-0.83]$.\n\n$\\{0.5,0.3\\}$ with sum $0.8{ }^{3}$ This problem comes up in many real-world situations. As an example, in graphic design, you have to fill all of the advertising slots of a magazine with advertisements. There are $N$ advertisers and the profit the publisher makes from the $n$-th sponsor is $x_{n}$ (some advertisements are loss leaders - a small loss is made on these - but the publisher is forced to fill out every advertising page in the magazine). Maximizing profit from the magazine is a matter of solving an instance of the maximum sum combination problem. The problem is specified mathematically as,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nX^{\\star}=\\underset{X^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{X}}{\\arg \\max } \\sum_{x^{\\prime} \\in X^{\\prime}} x^{\\prime} \\tag{6.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{X}$ is the set of all size $M$ combinations of the data items $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}$.\n\nFor the search neighbourhood, we will use the Hamming distance which in this case is the number of items in two combinations $X$ and $X^{\\prime}$ which differ. To see how good the result of this approximate search is, for small $N$ and $M$ at least, we can find the global optima using exhaustive search. Computational experiments confirm that for small $N$ and $M$, for Hamming distance $r=1$, approximate greedy search strategy apparently almost always finds the global maxima in a handful of iterations (see Table 6.1).\n\nFrom these experiments it seems that hill-climbing is a good solution to the problem. However, in fact this problem can be solved exactly by selecting the top $M$ items in the input data, which requires sorting the data with worst case computational complexity of $O(N \\log N)$. So, the computational efficiency of Hamming-distance based greedy approximation for this particular problem is doubtful: its success comes at the expense of very slow neighbourhood search. We can speed up the neighbourhood search\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
