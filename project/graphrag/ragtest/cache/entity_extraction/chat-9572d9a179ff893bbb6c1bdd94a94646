How to use these lecture notes\n\nThese notes have been designed to accompany the lectures and tutorials. The learning outcomes for each section (that is, what you should know or be able to do after reading that section thoroughly) are listed at the end of each section.\n\nIn these notes, we have highlighted specific terminology which is used in AI and ML in bold blue. These are technical terms you will need to familiarize yourself with, because they are used to shortcut discussions of technical issues, so, coursework and exam questions may be phrased in these terms. Other terms which have been borrowed from other disciplines but are not central to the topic are emphasized with italics, and other incidental that are useful or required for the discussion are highlighted in bold.\n\n1.3. Course content\n\nThis module introduces the core concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The principal focus of the module will be on the underlying principles such as knowledge representation, optimization, probability, and statistical learning. On successful completion of this module, the student should be able to:\n\n$\\triangleright$ Explain and discuss a range of problems and techniques in AI and ML\n\n$\\triangleright$ Compare AI and ML techniques, describing their strengths and limitations\n\n$\\triangleright$ Apply AI and ML techniques to solve problems\n\n1.4. Overview of AI and ML\n\nAI and ML address challenging real-world problems which require the manipulation or processing (computation) with information (data) in some way, to come up with rational decisions given this information. In principle, all these problems could be solved manually, but humans, unless paying careful attention, easily make mistakes or get tired, so this approach is not practical for many modern, large-scale problems.\n\nWhile all these problems could be solved by exhaustively generating or all possible solutions and testing them out one-by-one to select the best solution (AI), or storing all input-output patterns in memory and then just looking up the solution (ML), this is usually infeasible. A main motivation therefore of AI and ML is in coming up with \"smart\" solutions to solving complex problems under conditions of limited computational resources.\n\nExamples of real-world problems which can be solved, even if approximately, using techniques from AI and ML include:\n\n$\\triangleright$ GPS navigation; finding an optimal road route, possibly including waypoints and incorporating real-time traffic updates\n\n$\\triangleright$ Scheduling limited uplink/downlink radio channels for deep space communication\n\n$\\triangleright$ Image processing; such as colorizing black and white photographs\n\n$\\triangleright$ Text-based language translation\n\nLearning outcomes for section 1\n\n$\\triangleright$ Demonstrate understanding of the practical value of AI and ML algorithms and where they are applicable.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Be able to explain and reason broadly about the fundamental differences between symbolic AI and (statistical) ML.\n\nSection 2 . \n\nEssential mathematical background\n\nA good introduction to the necessary mathematics (ignore the examples), can be found in Gill, Section 1.2, Section 1.3, Section 1.4, Section 1.5, Section 1.6 and Section 1.7. These sections should be read now before going any further.\n\n2.1. Essential mathematical concepts\n\nTo study the material in this course there are various background mathematical concepts and terminology that you need to know and understand. Some of these concepts are just a matter of understanding the notation, and others are derived results (theorems) which you should know. Other, more specialized mathematical concepts, notation and terminology will be introduced later in the lecture material where needed.\n\n2.2. Mathematical notation in this module\n\nIn this course, we generally refer to natural numbers or integers using upper-case italics, i.e. $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ or $M \\in \\mathbb{N}\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
