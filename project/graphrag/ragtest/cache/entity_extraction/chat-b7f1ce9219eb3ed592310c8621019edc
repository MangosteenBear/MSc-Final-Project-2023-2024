The parameter $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the mean or average of the distribution, which locates the highest probablity density value of the function, and $\\sigma^{2}>0$ is the variance which measures the 'width' or 'spread' of the density around the mean (Figure 15.1).\n\nThe Gaussian has many remarkable properties. Among these: the mean, median (value which has as much probability on one side as the other) and mode (the highest probability value) are all equal to $\\mu$, and the distribution of a sum of an infinite number of random variables (with finite mean and variance), is Gaussian (via the famous central limit theorem). For this reason (and many others), the Gaussian is widely used in probabilstic ML and AI.\n\n\\footnotetext{\n${ }^{3}$ This normal distribution is a special case of the multivariate Gaussian for $D>1$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_a85a8bdeccdc3c134dcag-3.jpg?height=709&width=1027&top_left_y=328&top_left_x=503)\n\nFigure 15.1.: Density function (PDF) of the Gaussian distribution for a variety of mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$ parameter values.\n\n 15.2. Two or more random variables together: marginals, conditionals, independence\n\nTwo or more events occurring simultaneously are represented by joint RVs and corresponding joint PMFs and/or PDFs. For the case of two discrete RVs, $X$ and $Y$, the joint mass function is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\operatorname{Pr}(X=x \\text { and } Y=y)=P(X=x, Y=y) \\tag{15.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\ndefined on the joint sample space $\\Omega_{X} \\times \\Omega_{Y}$. As an example, consider the case of a coin flip paired with a dice throw, the joint sample space has $2 \\times 6=12$ possible outcomes,\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{X} \\times \\Omega_{Y}=\\{(H, 1),(H, 2),(H, 3),(H, 4),(H, 5),(H, 6),(T, 1),(T, 2),(T, 3),(T, 4),(T, 5),(T, 6)\\}\n$$\n\nAs a proper distribution function, the joint distribution must be normalized, so\n\n$\\sum_{(x, y) \\in \\Omega_{X} \\times \\Omega_{Y}} P(X=x, Y=y)=1$. For two continuous RVs, the joint PDF $p(x, y)$ is the density value at $x \\in \\Omega_{X}$ and $y \\in \\Omega_{Y}$ simultaneously. Clearly, joint density functions should be normalized, so we must have $\\int_{\\Omega_{X} \\times \\Omega_{Y}} p(x, y) d x d y=1$. Since the laws of probability apply equally to the discrete and continuous cases, we will usually use the shorthand $P_{X Y}(X, Y)$ for the joint distribution function of the random variables $X$ and $Y$, or where there is no ambiguity just $P(X, Y)$.\n\nA joint distribution contains all information about the joint RVs, so for instance, we can find the distribution function of one of the RVs from the joint, by marginalization,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& P(Y=y)=\\sum_{x \\in \\Omega_{X}} P(X=x, Y=y) \\\\\n& P(X=x)=\\sum_{y \\in \\Omega_{Y}} P(X=x, Y=y) \\tag{15.5}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand the same result applies to continuous distributions using integration rather than summation.\n\n| Joint $P(X=x, Y=y)$ | $y=0$ | $y=1$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $x=0$ | $\\frac{3}{7}$ | $\\frac{1}{7}$ |\n| $x=1$ | $\\frac{3}{15}$ | $\\frac{8}{35}$ |\n\n\n| Marginal $P(X=x)$ |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| $x=0$ | $P(X=0, Y=0)+P(X=0, Y=1)=\\frac{4}{7}$ |\n| $x=1$ | $P(X=1, Y=0)+P(X=1,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
