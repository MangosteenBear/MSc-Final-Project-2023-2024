Formulating optimal $K$-clustering\n\nA common data analysis problem which arises in practice is clustering. Given $N$ data points in $D$-dimensional data space, e.g. $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$, what is the optimal way to partition the set of data into $K$ groups? Clustering is an example of an unsupervised ML problem: we do not have any associated labels. As discussed in Section 3, we can always use an exhaustive combinatorial algorithm, i.e. find all possible ways of partitioning the set of indices $\\{1,2, \\ldots, N\\}$ into $K$ blocks, then find the optimal partition. However, the number of such set partitions is the Stirling numbers of the 2nd kind, for K fixed this number increases like $O\\left(K^{N}\\right)$ (exponential) so exact combinatorial optimization algorithms are intractable. Therefore, in ML, approximate clustering methods are nearly always used in practice.\n\nTo solve the problem computationally, we need to formalize it mathematically. We will treat it as a $K$-clustering problem: partitioning the data into $K$ non-overlapping clusters such that some objective function of this clustering configuration is minimized. We will use indicator function notation $X_{i k}$, to represent a clustering partition as a combinatorial configuration,\n\n$$\nX_{i k}= \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { data item } x_{i} \\text { is assigned to cluster } k  \\tag{10.1}\\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAs an example, if we have data $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{5}$ and $K=3$ classes, then the configuration,\n\n$$\nX=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}\n0 & 0 & 1  \\tag{10.2}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nimplies $x_{1}, x_{2}$ are assigned to cluster $3, x_{3}$ is assigned to cluster 1 and $x_{4}, x_{5}$ are assigned to cluster 2. This form is very convenient mathematically because we can then express the so-called $K$-means objective, a widely-used measure of clustering quality, directly in terms of this indicator function,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nF(X, \\mu)=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} X_{i k}\\left\\|x_{i}-\\mu_{k}\\right\\|^{2} \\tag{10.3}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere in this equation, \\|\\|$^{2}$ is the square Euclidean norm of a vector, which is just the sum of squares of each dimension,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_74606bd6d52a196f1278g-2.jpg?height=749&width=941&top_left_y=299&top_left_x=546)\n\nFigure 10.1.: Illustrating the objective function of $K$-means clustering in $D=2$ and a partition of $K=2$ clusters. This shows the measure of clustering quality $F(X, \\mu)=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} X_{i k}\\left\\|x_{i}-\\mu_{k}\\right\\|^{2}$ where the terms $\\left\\|x_{i}-\\mu_{k}\\right\\|$ are the Euclidean distances between the coordinates of the cluster centroid $\\mu_{k}$ (cross) and the coordinates of the data point $x_{i}$ (dot). The colour (black, blue) indicates the assignment of the data point to clusters, given by the partition indicator (configuration) $X_{i k}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\|v\\|^{2}=\\sum_{d=1}^{D}\\left(v^{d}\\right)^{2} \\tag{10.4}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThe quantity $\\mu_{k}$ is the average of the data in each coordinate of each cluster, which is called the centroid for that cluster, which we can also write as,\n\n$$\n\\mu_{k}=\\frac{1}{N_{k}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i k} x_{i}, \\quad N_{k}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i k}\n$$\n\nIt is helpful to visualize an example $K$-clustering in $D=2$, showing how the objective is sensitive to the spread of the data around the centroids (Figure 10.1).\n\nThe $K$-means clustering problem thus attempts to solve the following optimization problem,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left(X^{\\star}, \\mu^{\\star}\\right)=\\underset{\\left(X^{\\prime}, \\mu^{\\prime}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{W}}{\\arg \\min } F\\left(X^{\\prime}, \\mu^{\\prime}\\right) \\tag{10.5}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{W}$ is the set of all possible partitions (i.e\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
