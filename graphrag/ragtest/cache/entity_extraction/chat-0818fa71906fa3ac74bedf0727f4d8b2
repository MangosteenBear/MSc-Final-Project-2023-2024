The $K$-means algorithm\n\nNote that, given fixed clustering configuration $X$, we can always find the globally optimal corresponding centroids $\\mu$, and given fixed $\\mu$, we can determine the globally optimal corresponding configuration\n\n\nAlgorithm 10.1 The $K$-means algorithm for approximate clustering.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Step 1. Initialization: Start with $n=0$ and an initial guess for all centroids $\\mu_{k}^{0}$ for $k=$ $1,2, \\ldots, K$,\n\n$\\triangleright$ Step 2. Update configuration: Set all entries in $X^{n+1}=0$, except where $k=$ $\\arg \\min _{k^{\\prime}=1,2, \\ldots, K}\\left\\|x_{i}-\\mu_{k^{\\prime}}\\right\\|^{2}$, for which $X_{i k}^{n+1}=1$,\n\n$\\triangleright$ Step 3. Update centroids: Compute $\\mu_{k}^{n+1}=\\frac{1}{N_{k}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i k}^{n+1} x_{i}$ where $N_{k}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i k}^{n+1}$,\n\n$\\triangleright$ Step 4. Convergence check: If $n>0$ and $X^{n+1}=X^{n}$, then exit with solution $X^{\\star}=X^{n+1}$ and $\\mu^{\\star}=\\mu^{n+1}$,\n\n$\\triangleright$ Step 5. Iteration: Update $n=n+1$ and go back to step 2 .\n\n$X$, so they actually contain the same information. ${ }^{1}$ This suggests an idea: start with a good guess for each cluster centroid $\\mu_{k}$, then use these guesses to compute the optimal corresponding partition entries in $X_{i k}$; now use that to get a better guess for all the $\\mu_{k}$, and so on. The resulting algorithm is known as $K$-means clustering (Algorithm (10.1)).\n\nWe can show that $F\\left(X^{n+1}, \\mu^{n+1}\\right) \\leq F\\left(X^{n}, \\mu^{n}\\right)$ the $K$-means objective (10.3) is never increasing (because given $\\mu$ we can find the X with globally smallest $F$, and vice-versa). So, the $K$-means algorithm always converges on a fixed point (that is, it finds a minima of $F$ and stays there for all subsequent iterations). But, we cannot know if the minima is local or global, furthermore we cannot know in advance how many iterations it takes to converge (typically $7-15$ iterations from experience, but there are no guarantees about this). Another limitation of the algorithm is the potential for pathological cases, for instance, in updating configurations (step 2), it is perfectly possible for a cluster to have no data items assigned to it; then it is impossible to find the centroid for that cluster on the next step. ${ }^{2}$\n\nBecause of the exponential number of ways of partitioning a set into $K$ clusters, most initial guesses for the configuration $X$ can be substantially improved upon. Figure 10.2 shows the typical evolution of the $K$-means objective function during a run of the $K$-means algorithm, showing how the improvement in objective is usually fast at the start and then slows down at convergence. Convergence usually takes only a handful of iterations in practice.\n\n10.3. Example: patch-based digital image dictionaries\n\nHere is an interesting problem in wildlife conservation where a clustering problem arises. Remote, battery-operated digital cameras are set up in the wild to take images of wildlife for ecological purposes such as tracking and counting. Because the cameras are expected to operate entirely remotely for many months at a time, they have to be extremely energy-efficient. This restricts the amount of computational processing they can have on board (fast, capable processors are energy-hungry). All the digital images have to be analyzed to determine whether they should be stored or discarded since memory is limited on the hardware. However, each digital image contains a lot of information. For instance, a single image of around 300 by 600 pixels requires 600 kb and the camera take an image\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_74606bd6d52a196f1278g-4.jpg?height=660&width=1286&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=379)\n\nFigure 10.2.: The typical evolution of the $K$-means objective function value $F\\left(X^{n}, \\mu^{n}\\right)$ during iteration of the $K$-means algorithm (Algorithm 10.1).\n\nevery minute, so 1440 images per day means processing close to 1 Gb per\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
