We can immediately see the child/parent relationships between variables; some of them: $V$ is a parent of both $U$ and $Z, Y$ is a child of $X$ and $X$ is a child of $U$ in turn. We can therefore read off the conditional independence relationships, for example, $P(Z \\mid V, U)=P(Z \\mid V, U, X, Y)$ (in words, $Z$ is conditionally independent of $X$ and $Y$ given $U$ and $V), P(Y \\mid X)=P(Y \\mid X, Z)$ ( $Y$ is conditionally independent of $Z$ given $X$ ).\n\nIndependence/conditional independence such as this, is of critical important in probabilistic AI and ML, since it allows joint RVs to be efficiently modelled by subsets of the data. This is the basis of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), which we explore in detail in the next section. We will study several examples of PGMs for practical ML algorithms in later sections.\n\n 15.3. Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs)\n\nGiven a probability distribution with multiple RVs, we can represent their mutual conditional independence graphically using a probabilistic graphical model (PGM). This is an directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which the nodes in the graph are the RVs such as $X, Y, Z$ etc. and the edges $X \\rightarrow Y$ represent the conditional dependence relationship, $P(Y \\mid X)$, between them. We say that $X$ is a parent of $Y$ in the graph, and $Y$ is a child of $X$. Stated another (equivalent) way, which is often more useful for modelling purposes in ML, if $V$ has some parent variables in a PGM, but there is no edge $U \\rightarrow V$, then $V$ is conditionally independent of $U$, given its parents. PGMs have widespread use in probabilistic AI and ML, there are special graph structures for applications such as time series or image data. See Figure 15.2 for a simple example PGM.\n\nEvery joint distribution over a set of multiple RVs, can be expressed using the chain rule of probability ${ }^{4}$, which is a product of their conditionals. For example, in the three variable case there are six different 'chain-factored' expressions,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nP(X, Y, Z) & =P(X \\mid Y, Z) P(Y \\mid Z) P(Z) \\\\\n& =P(Y \\mid X, Z) P(X \\mid Z) P(Z) \\\\\n& =P(Y \\mid Z, X) P(Z \\mid X) P(X) \\\\\n& =P(Z \\mid Y, X) P(Y \\mid X) P(X)  \\tag{15.7}\\\\\n& =P(Z \\mid X, Y) P(X \\mid Y) P(Y) \\\\\n& =P(X \\mid Z, Y) P(Z \\mid Y) P(Y)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n\\footnotetext{\n${ }^{4}$ Not to be confused with the chain rule of distribution!\n\nIn fact for $N$ variables there are $N$ ! such factorizations, one for every permutation of the variables. Note that these factorizations of the joint expression into products of conditionals, are true regardless of the conditional independence properties of their joint distribution. ${ }^{5}$ What makes this chain factorization useful is when it is combined with the parent/child structure of the graph and the conditional independence properties it dictates. We can find a sequence of variables e.g. $[X, U, V]$ or $[U, V, X]$, such that, every variable in the sequence occurs after its parents (or before its children), in the DAG. Such a sequence (there can be more than one of them) is called a topological ordering of the DAG. For instance, in Figure 15.2, a topological ordering is $[V, U, X, Y, Z]$. This ordering is a permutation, so we can now write down the corresponding chain factorization according to that permutation. For instance, according to the permutation $[V, U, X, Y, Z]$, we have the specific chain factorization,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP(V, U, X, Y, Z)=P(V) P(U \\mid V) P(X \\mid U, V) P(Y \\mid X, U, V) P(Z \\mid Y, X, U, V) \\tag{15.8}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nHowever, note that, according to the conditional independence properties implied by the PGM, we can simplify some of the above conditionals,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nP(Z \\mid Y, X, U, V) & =P(Z \\mid U, V) \\\\\nP(Y \\mid X, U, V) & =P(Y \\mid X)  \\tag{\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
