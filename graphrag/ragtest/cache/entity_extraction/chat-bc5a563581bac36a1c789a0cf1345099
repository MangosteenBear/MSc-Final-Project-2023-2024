Other, more specialized mathematical concepts, notation and terminology will be introduced later in the lecture material where needed.\n\n2.2. Mathematical notation in this module\n\nIn this course, we generally refer to natural numbers or integers using upper-case italics, i.e. $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ or $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$. A closed subset of the real is given by $[a, b]$, and an open set is $] a, b[$. A set of distinct values is written $\\{a, b, c \\ldots\\}$. Names for special sets use calligraphic symbols e.g. $\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{Y}$. Real variables are written in lower-case italics, i.e. $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. A sequence of $N$ variables is written $x_{1}, x_{2} \\ldots, x_{N}$. Lower case letters generally refer to integer indices, as in $x_{n}$ for $n=1,2,3 \\ldots, N$. A function is generally denoted $f(x)$ or $F(x)$. For differentiating once, we write $f^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{d}{d x} f(x)$; the partial derivative is written $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x)$. Multidimensional integration over a set $A$ is written $\\int_{A} d x d y d z \\ldots$ or just $\\int_{A} d x$ if the context is clear. The probability of a set $A$ is denoted $\\operatorname{Pr}(A)$. A probability distribution function or density function is written $P(x)$ or $p(x)$.\n\n2.3. Plotting functions\n\nIn order to get some idea about a function, it is often very helpful to visualize it. A good plot satisfies the following criteria:\n\n1. It should be informative and clear:\n\na) The scale of the axes should be adapted to the scale of the data, and/or the range of the function.\n\nb) Axes should be labeled.\n\nc) It should have a legend and/or a caption which explains what has been plotted and what any symbols and colours mean.\n\n2. It should be neat and easy to read. Some tips for achieving this:\n\na) Use graph paper and/or a computer algebra package (such as Mathematica).\n\nb) Draw straight lines using a ruler.\n\nc) Distinguish different lines and points using colour and/or different line types (i.e. solid, dashed, dotted etc.)\n\nWhen plotting a function by hand, you should keep the following in mind:\n\n1. Unless otherwise restricted, a function $f(x)$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ maps each value of $x$ to a unique point $y=f(x)$ on your graph, so, if there is any potential for ambiguity (for example, where a function has a jump) you should make the actual value clear using a thick point.\n2. One way to plot a function qualitatively by hand, is to find a few important $x_{i}$ values (e.g. where the function crosses zero, where there are singularities or jumps etc.), then connect the points $\\left(x_{i}, f\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right)$ as smoothly as possible. Where the points you have chosen just have convenience for your plotting, they should not be visible on the plot when it is finished.\n\nLearning outcomes for section 2\n\n$\\triangleright$ Knowledge of the elementary mathematical concepts used in this module.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Familiarity with the mathematical notation used in this module.\n\n$\\triangleright$ How to plot mathematical functions.\n\nPart II.\n\nSymbolic artificial intelligence \n\nSection 3.\n\nCombinatorial optimization\n\nRelevant reference reading material for this section are MLSP, Section 1.8, Section 2.6; CLRS, Chapter 3 and $\\mathbf{R} \\& \\mathbf{N}$, Section A.1.\n\n3.1. Optimizing objective functions\n\nMany problems in symbolic AI can be formulated mathematically as optimization problems. These are formulated as minimizing ${ }^{1}$ an objective function $F(X)$ with respect to a set of all possible configurations, $\\mathcal{X}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nX^{\\star}=\\underset{X^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{X}}{\\arg \\min } F\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right) . \\tag{3.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nAn exact method/algorithm, is guaranteed to find (one of) the globally optimal values of (3.1). Mathematically, we say that $x$ is globally optimal if it satisfies,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nF\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq F\\left(X^{\\star}\\right), \\forall X^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{X} \\tag{3.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBy contrast, an approximate method/algorithm is only guaranteed to find a locally optimal value (a value which is \"good enough\"). Note that this locally optimal value could also be globally optimal, but the point is that we cannot be sure of this. Stated mathematically, the configuration $x$ is locally optimal if, for some subset (some restricted part) $\\mathcal{N} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$ of the whole set of possible configurations,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
