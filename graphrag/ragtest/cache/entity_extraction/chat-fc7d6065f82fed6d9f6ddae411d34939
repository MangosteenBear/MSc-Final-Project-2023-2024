Since this DP algorithm runs in linear time, it can be easily applied to the usually extremely long DNA sequences encountered in biology (i.e. the human genome has about 6 billion base pairs), and is a good example of the ubiquitous use of ML in modern bioinformatics.\n\nAn important computational point needs to be raised. The optimal probabilities $p_{t}^{\\star}(y)$ eventually become extremely small and difficult to work with computationally, this is a consequence of long sequences leading to long iterated products of probabilities in the recursion (17.6). A practical solution is to work with log-probabilities instead, that is, first take the logarithm of every probability, then since $\\ln (p \\times q)=\\ln p+\\ln q$, the recursion involves sums of log-probabilities rather than products, and the Viterbi decoding is otherwise unchanged. ${ }^{2}$\n\n[^0]\n Learning outcomes for section 17\n\n$\\triangleright$ Demonstrate knowledge of the structure of the HMM: Markov chains and hidden states, relationship to observed data.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Explain the function of the steps of the Viterbi decoding algorithm.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Apply the Viterbi decoding algorithm to small sequence decoding problems.\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ This works because the maximum distributes over sum as it does over the product, the condition required for the principle of optimality to hold.\n Section 18. \n\n Other sequential models\n\nRelevant reference reading material for this section can be found in MLSP, Section 7.5, PRML, Section 13.3 and R\\&N, Section 15, Section 17.\n\n 18.1. Optimal sequential decision-making\n\nMaking a sequence of choices based on observed effects of those choices, is a common problem in real-world planning and decision-making. Ideally, we want to decide on a sequence of actions which are optimal (the best possible decisions which can be made) with respect to the available information about the effects of these decisions. The problem of computing the optimal decision sequence or policy, can make use of dynamic programming applied to a special kind of sequential graphical model, known as a Markov decision process (MDP) (Figure 18.1).\n\nAn MDP represents a sequence of input actions $A_{t}$ which lead to a sequence of observed states, $S_{t}$ for $t=1,2, \\ldots, T$. Each state has an associated reward $R\\left(S_{t}\\right)$ which is a deterministic function of the state. ${ }^{1}$ A sequence of states has a utility which is a deterministic function of all these states $U\\left(S_{1}, \\ldots, S_{T}\\right)$. Methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) uses observed rewards which are a function of the MDP state, to learn an optimal action sequence (policy), and is mainstay of modern AI in, for instance robotics and fine-tuning of large language models.\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_b6faca892de9afbc5a1cg-1.jpg?height=358&width=895&top_left_y=1974&top_left_x=592)\n\nFigure 18.1.: Markov decision processes (MDP) are probabilsitic graphical models in which a sequence of actions $A_{t}$ influences a sequence of observed states $S_{t}$ in the world, which themselves also depend upon previous states.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_b6faca892de9afbc5a1cg-2.jpg?height=412&width=972&top_left_y=325&top_left_x=542)\n\nFigure 18.2.: The Kalman filter is a probabilistic model which captures dependence in time for a continuous state variable $Z_{t}$, upon which noisy observations of the state $X_{t}$ depend. This has identical probabilistic dependence structure to the HMM.\n\n 18.2. Kalman filter\n\nSimilar to HMMs but for situations with continuous hidden state, the Kalman filter is often used for target tracking or motion smoothing with noisy observations. This has a wide array of applications in, for instance, automated airplane (autopilot) or ship guidance. For the linear-Gaussian case $^{2}$, the Kalman filter can be conceptualized as a predictor-corrector process to estimate the hidden state, which alternates between the two steps:\n\n1. Using a model, predict the next state from the current estimate of the state,\n2. When the next noisy observation of the state becomes available, correct the last prediction using a suitably weighted average of the noisy observation and the previous prediction.\n\nIt turns out that the weighted average arises directly from the use of Bayes' theorem, which optimally balances the uncertainty in the predictions, against the uncertainty in the noisy observations.\n\nThe Kalman filter captures dependence in time which is not directly observed, each continuous hidden state $Z_{t}$ depends only upon the one before it in time, $Z_{t-1}$ for all $t=1,2, \\ldots, T$. The noisy observations $X_{t}$ depend only upon the associated hidden state, $Z_{t}$ (Figure 18.2). The simplest (and most widely encountered) model is a linear-Gaussian recurrence relation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nZ_{t} & =A Z_{t-1}+U \\\\\nX_{t} & =B Z_{t}+V \\tag{18.1}\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
