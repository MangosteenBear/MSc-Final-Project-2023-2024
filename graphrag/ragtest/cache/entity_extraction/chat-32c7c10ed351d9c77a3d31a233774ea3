categorical sample space $\\Omega_{X} \\times \\Omega_{Y}=\\{0,1\\} \\times\\{0,1\\}$. The fact that $P(X, Y) \\neq P(X) P(Y)$ means that $X$ and $Y$ are not independent.\n\nProperly normalized, fixing one variable allows the joint to act as a new distribution called the conditional,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& P(X=x \\mid Y=y)=\\frac{P(X=x, Y=y)}{P(Y=y)} \\\\\n& P(Y=y \\mid X=x)=\\frac{P(X=x, Y=y)}{P(X=x)} \\tag{15.6}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand we use the shorthand $P(X \\mid Y)$ and $P(Y \\mid X)$. Both marginals and conditionals can be extended to multiple joint random variables through summation or division by joint subsets. See Table 15.1 for a worked example in the case of the joint categorical distribution.\n\nIf the probability of a conditional distribution $P(X \\mid Y)$ is unaffected by the conditioning variable $Y$, we say that $X$ is independent of $Y$. In other words, if $P(X \\mid Y)=P(X)$, then we can rearrange this to write $P(X, Y)=P(X) P(Y)$ so the joint distribution is factored into a product of the marginal distributions (Table 15.2).\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_a85a8bdeccdc3c134dcag-5.jpg?height=450&width=449&top_left_y=289&top_left_x=809)\n\nFigure 15\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
