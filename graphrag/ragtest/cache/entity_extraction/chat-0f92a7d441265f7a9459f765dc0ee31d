Example: AD for multilayer perceptrons\n\nAD applied to deep learning is straightforward. For example, the simple two layer network with two hidden nodes and $D=2$ dimensional input with ReLU activations and perceptron loss, has the forward computation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nz^{1} & =\\operatorname{relu}\\left(w_{1,1} x^{1}+w_{2,1} x^{2}\\right) \\\\\nz^{2} & =\\operatorname{relu}\\left(w_{1,2} x^{1}+w_{2,2} x^{2}\\right)  \\tag{14.8}\\\\\nF\\left(w_{1,1}\\right) & =\\operatorname{relu}\\left(-y \\times\\left(v_{1} z^{1}+v_{2} z^{2}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe resulting computations are shown in Table 14.1. Gradients of the output with respect to the rest of the parameters, e.g. $F\\left(w_{1,2}\\right)$ and $F\\left(v_{1}\\right)$ etc. are computed similarly; in practice all gradients are computed in parallel using vector arithmetic.\n\n Learning outcomes for section 14\n\n$\\triangleright$ Be able to explain the purpose of automatic differentiation, its importance for deep learning, and how it differs from numerical and symbolic differentation.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Explain and demonstrate how automatic differentiation can be computed using dual numbers.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Perform simple gradient computations using dual numbers.\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ There are different computational trade-offs between AD schemes, even though all schemes should, in principal, compute the exact same value of the gradient.\n\n    ${ }^{2}$ Some ML researchers call AD differentiable computing for this reason.\n\n[^1]:    ${ }^{3}$ For those familiar with complex numbers, dual numbers are similar in that the real line is extended to the twodimensional plane with the additional infinitessimal coordinate, $\\epsilon$, along with the rule that $\\epsilon^{2}=0$, much as $i^{2}=-1$ in complex numbers.\n Section 15. \n\n Probability and probabilistic graphical models\n\nRelevant reference reading material for this section are MLSP, Section 1.4, Section 1.6, Section 5.1, Section 5.2, PRML, Section 8.1, Section 8.2 and R\\&N, Section 14.1, Section 14.2 .\n\n 15.1.

Probability provides a mathematical calculus for reasoning about random events, conveniently indexed using random variables (RV) which can be discrete or continuous.
