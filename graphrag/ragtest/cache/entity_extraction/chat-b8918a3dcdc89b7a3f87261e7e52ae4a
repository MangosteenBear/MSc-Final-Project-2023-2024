This is known as Bayes' theorem and is so widely used that the terms in this equation have special names. $P(X)$ is called the prior, $P(Y \\mid X)$ the likelihood, $P(Y)$ evidence and $P(X \\mid Y)$ is the posterior. For practical reasons, if we do not know the evidence distribution, it is often presented in the following, equivalent form, ${ }^{1}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP(X \\mid Y)=\\frac{P(Y \\mid X) P(X)}{\\sum_{x \\in \\Omega_{X}} P(Y \\mid X=x) P(X=x)} \\tag{16.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nBayes' theorem is just a mathematical fact, but it has critical applications for rational decisionmaking under uncertainty in probabilistic AI and ML. Here is an example which illustrates the point. Consider the problem of determining probabilities of a range of health states of an individual, given a symptom. Precision computations are required because one of the outcomes is meningitis which is a life-threatening condition: it should be quickly treated and will often require hospitalization, but again a false positive has substantial cost.\n\nTo set up a probabilistic model, assume an RV $S=0$ if an individual does not have a specific symptom and $S=1$ if they have that symptom ( $S$ is Bernoulli-distributed with sample space $\\Omega_{S}=$ $\\{0,1\\})$. This symptom could prompt three possible outcomes $-D=h$, healthy, $D=c$ influenza and $D=m$ for meningitis ( $D$ has a categorical distribution with sample space $\\Omega_{D}=\\{h, c, m\\}$ ). Assume the likelihoods are known, i.e. the probability of a specific health state given the symptom is present:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nP(S=1 \\mid D=h)=0.1 \\\\\nP(S=1 \\mid D=c)=0.5  \\tag{16.3}\\\\\nP(S=1 \\mid D=m)=0.9\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFrom the general medical literature, the priors for the health state are known (that is, the background probability of each health state in the population at large):\n\n\\footnotetext{\n${ }^{1}$ To see why this is correct, note that $P\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
