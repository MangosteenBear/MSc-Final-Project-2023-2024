Probability provides a mathematical calculus for reasoning about random events, conveniently indexed using random variables (RV) which can be discrete or continuous. Probability functions obey the rules (axioms) of probability, which are:\n\n1. $\\operatorname{Pr}(A) \\geq 0$,\n2. $\\operatorname{Pr}(A \\cup B)=\\operatorname{Pr}(A)+\\operatorname{Pr}(B)$ provided $A \\cap B=\\emptyset$,\n3. $\\operatorname{Pr}(\\Omega)=1$.\n\nHere, $\\operatorname{Pr}(A)$ refers to the probability of random event $A, \\Omega$ refers to the set of all possible events ${ }^{1}$ which is also known as the sample space of the model, and $\\emptyset$ is the empty set (the impossible event). In words, the first rule states that probabilities are non-negative real numbers. The second states that the probabillity of non-overlapping events is the sum of their individual probabilities. The third states that the probability of any event occurring, is 1, i.e. it is inevitable that some event occurs.\n\nProbability models come in two main kinds: discrete and continuous. Discrete probability mass functions (PMF) give the probability that the RV $X$ takes on the value $x$, written in shorthand as $P(X=x)$. It is an actual probability so it lies in the range $[0,1]$. Furthermore it must be normalized, so $\\sum_{x \\in \\Omega_{X}} P(X=x)=1$, where $\\Omega_{X}$ is the sample space for $X$. A continuous probability density function (PDF) $p(x)$ gives the amount of probability per unit (probability density). A PDF must satisfy $p(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\Omega_{X}$. The volume under this function (a generalization of the area under a unidimensional PDF ), gives the probability of the event represented by that volume and is calculated using integration, $\\int_{x \\in A} p(x) d x=\\operatorname{Pr}(A)$ and it must be normalized, $\\int_{\\Omega_{X}} p(x) d x=1 .{ }^{2}$ For the purposes of this course \"summation for discrete, integration for continuous\" is a good heuristic under which nearly all of probability calculus is the same for both discrete and continuous distributions. Some examples of discrete RVs follow.\n\n[^0]The Bernoulli distribution, which is a binary RV, is a good model for a 'biased coin flip'. With the sample space $\\Omega_{X}=\\{0,1\\}$, the associated probability (mass) function is given by $P(X=0)=1-p$ and $P(X=1)=p$, where $p \\in[0,1]$ is the only parameter. This is normalized because,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{x \\in\\{0,1\\}} P(X=x) & =P(X=0)+P(X=1) \\\\\n& =1-p+p  \\tag{15.1}\\\\\n& =1\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe case $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ represents a fair coin.\n\nThe (discrete) uniform distribution has a finit\n\ne sample space such as $\\Omega_{X}=\\{1,2, \\ldots, N\\}$, where each event is equally likely, $P(X=x)=\\frac{1}{N}$, so it is normalized, $\\sum_{x=1}^{N} P(X=x)=\\sum_{x=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{N}=1$. An obvious example is the fair dice with $N=6$, so $P(X=x)=\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe uniform distribution is a special case of the categorical distribution where each outcome can have a different probability, so $P(X=x)=p_{x}$, which means there are $N$ parameter values in the length $N$ vector, indexed by $x$. Each $p_{x}$ is a probability value, so it must satisfy $0 \\leq p_{x} \\leq 1$. For example, for $N=3$, the categorical distribution $p=[0.25,0.25,0.5]$ has $p_{1}=0.25, p_{2}=0.25$ and $p_{3}=0.5$.\n\nA more complex distribution is the binomial distribution which can be considered a model of a sequence of independent, but biased, coin flips (i.e. Bernoulli distributed events). It can be shown that the probability of any sequence of flips with $x \\leq N$ heads is $(1-p)^{N-x} p^{x}$. The number of ways of obtaining $x$ heads in this sequence is given by the binomial coefficient,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\binom{N}{x}=\\frac{N!}{x!(N-x)!} \\tag{15.2}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nThis is the number of combinations of $k$ elements among $N$, from which we obtain the binomial mass function,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP(X=x)=\\binom{N}{x}(1-p)^{N-x} p^{x} \\text {. } \\tag{15.3}\n\\end{\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
