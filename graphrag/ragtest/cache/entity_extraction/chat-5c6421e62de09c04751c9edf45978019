Markov chains and the hidden Markov model\n\nMany applications of ML involve ordered data that is, data for which the ordering matters. Examples include:\n\n$\\triangleright$ Natural language (ordered sequences of words)\n\n$\\triangleright$ Appointment calendar entries (date and time-ordered event names)\n\n$\\triangleright$ Medical symptom diaries (e.g. time-ordered records of pain measurements)\n\n$\\triangleright$ Electronic health records (time-ordered sequences of medical system interactions)\n\n$\\triangleright$ Macroeconomic time series (time-ordered sequences of GDP values)\n\n$\\triangleright$ Genomics (base pairs in a genome sequence)\n\nWhat has been shown is that ML algorithms such as regression and classification are more useful if they take into account this ordering. For probabilistic $\\mathrm{AI} / \\mathrm{ML}$ this requires special kinds of PGMs, a primary example of which is the so-called Markov chain in which a sequence of RVs $Y_{0}, Y_{1}, \\ldots, Y_{T}$ is organized such that the next one in the sequence only depends upon the previous one, i.e. the PGM where,\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP\\left(Y_{t} \\mid Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \\ldots, Y_{0}\\right)=P\\left(Y_{t} \\mid Y_{t-1}\\right) \\tag{17.1}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nfor all $t=1,2, \\ldots, T$, along with the independent $Y_{0}$ to get the iteration started. If there are many sequences of data then (17.1) can be fitted to the data and used to make predictions. In practical applications, however, it is more common that the sequence $Y_{0}, Y_{1}, \\ldots, Y_{T}$ is not actually measured. The appropriate PGM for this situation is called the hidden Markov model (HMM) (Figure 17.1), where there is an edge $Y_{t-1} \\rightarrow Y_{t}$ and another $Y_{t} \\rightarrow X_{t}$ are called hidden states and the variables $Y_{t}$ the observations. Typically, the hidden states are discrete with finite sample space $\\Omega_{Y}$. The observations therefore only depend upon the hidden state at the same time instant.\n\nIn applications where HMM are used, there is the need to solve the following problems:\n\n$\\triangleright$ Model fitting: given only the sequence of observed data $X_{0}, X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{T}$, estimate the distribution functions in the PGM, i.e. find $P\\left(X_{t} \\mid Y_{t}\\right)$ (the distribution which models how the observed data depends upon the hidden states) and $P\\left(Y_{t} \\mid Y_{t-1}\\right)$ (the distribution of the current state given the previous one),\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_30_7cba98d7a35fdf29e4a8g-2.jpg?height=401&width=969&top_left_y=308&top_left_x=543)\n\nFigure 17.1.: The probabilistic graphical model (PGM) of the hidden Markov model (HMM).\n\n$\\triangleright$ Evaluation: given fixed model parameters and complete sequence of observed data, compute the probability of the complete sequence of observed data, $P(X)$, and,\n\n$\\triangleright$ Decoding: given fixed model parameters, and data compute the most probable sequence of hidden states, $y^{\\star}=\\left[y_{0}^{\\star}, y_{1}^{\\star}, \\ldots, y_{T}^{\\star}\\right]$.\n\nOn the face of it, solving these problems requires evaluating all possible sequences of hidden states which we denote by $\\mathcal{Y}$; if there are $K$ hidden states, this means $O\\left(K^{T}\\right)$ (exponential complexity). However, the use of dynamic programming (Section 5) makes this tractable, leading to efficient, lineartime $O\\left(T K^{2}\\right)$ inference algorithms.\n\n 17.2.
